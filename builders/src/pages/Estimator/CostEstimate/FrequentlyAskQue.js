              In case of avoidable delays in the project, we have strict penalty
              clauses where the customer is monetarily compensated. Our
              construction project management software helps to manage the
              construction activity to give us live updates and helps us to
              avoid any delays in construction projects.

            </p>
            <p>
              Not all houses have a compound. Then, there are houses which
              require a compound wall on just two or three sides. By removing
              the compound wall from the package, we ensure that only the
              clients who opt for a compound wall, pay for it.

                4. What happens if I want different brand of materials other
                than the one's in the packages?

              Our packages are developed in a modular manner. Hence, any change
              in specification is as simple as add something to your shopping
              cart and remove something from the shopping cart. Our technical
              consultants can give a demo on this.
